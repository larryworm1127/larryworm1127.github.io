Dear Hiring Managers,

I am a current 3rd year Computer Science student studying at University of Toronto and I would love to bring my expertise, skills and enthusiasm to your software development team.

I am a fast learner who can pick up new concepts quickly, especially when it comes to new programming languages and APIs, and I adapt well to new working environments.

From my two years in universties as well as various side projects that I made in my free time, I have built a variety software projects, ranging from simple routers and file systems using C language, to Android apps using Java/Kotlin, and web apps using JavaScript and Python. I believe my various experiences make me a strong condidate for this position.

It would be a pleasure to share more of my expertise with you. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, \\
Larry Shi
